A simple currency converter targets to polish users.
It can convert *PLN* into *EUR/USD/GBP* or *EUR/USD/GBP* into *PLN*.
## Demo

## why I made it?
Because I'm learning frontend and it was one of the homeworks.
I'd like to add integration with WebAPI of Polish National Bank in the future, but I cannot to do it yet :)
